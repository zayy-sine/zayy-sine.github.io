    <h2>1. Purpose of the App</h2>
    <p>
      The App is a platform that provides ordering management services for users
      on multiple social media platforms, including Facebook, Discord, and
      Telegram. Users can manage their pages and bots through the App, and
      collect associated data from their social media accounts, including email,
      username, account name, profile picture, age, encrypted password, and
      social page list.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection and Storage</h2>
    <p>
      We collect data from users' social media accounts in order to provide our
      services. We store this data on our storage server and main backup server
      database, and take appropriate measures to protect user data.
      User-generated content, such as product names, images, prices, and likes,
      is also stored securely.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not share user data with any third parties at this time. However, we
      may use Google Analytics and Firebase Cloud Messaging in the future to
      improve user experience for our application.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Age Restriction</h2>
    <p>
      The App is intended for users who are 13 years of age or older, and is not
      intended for children.
    </p>

    <h2>5. User-Generated Content</h2>
    <p>
      Users are allowed to generate their own content, including product names,
      images, prices, and likes. However, we reserve the right to remove any
      content that is deemed inappropriate or violates our policies.
    </p>
